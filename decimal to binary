Algorithm for converting decimal to binary

The decimal number 5 will be used as an example

Step 1: Divide the decimal number by 2 and record the remainder
        Ex: 5 / 2 = 2, remainder 1
        
Step 2: Write down the remainder as the first digit (from the right) of the binary number
        Ex: _ _ 1
        
        note: I put 3 spaces here because I already know 5 in binary has 3 digits. This is just for the sake of making it clear where to place the digits
        
Step 3: Repeat the above steps, dividing the quotient, and recording the remainder until your quotient is 0. Make sure to write down the remainder on the left of the previous digit
        Ex: 2 / 2 = 1, remainder 0      
            > _ 0 1
            
            1 / 2 = 0, remainder 1
            > 1 0 1
            
            101 is 5 in binary
